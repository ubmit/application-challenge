You will need a runtime compatible with TypeScript to run the `index.ts` without any compiling step. I'd personally suggest [Bun](https://bun.sh), which you can install by running:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run start
```

or

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.25. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
